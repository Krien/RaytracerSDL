# RaytracerSDL
Again a port of my old raytracer. This time to c++ with SDL. 
#NOTE
This only contains the logic itself. This will NOT compile without adding libraries and setting a few settings.
First of all you need to have SDL2.lib and SDL2main.lib. It also makes use of Agner Fog's library VCL and the VCL add on 
https://github.com/vectorclass and https://github.com/vectorclass/add-on/.  It works on both x64 and x86.
